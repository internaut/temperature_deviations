# Day temperature deviations

Markus Konrad <post@mkonrad.net>, August 2024

## Overview

This repository contains an RMarkdown document that shows how to model seasonal day temperature changes in R with a simple linear model. We then go on to analyze the residuals from this model to identify years with low and high deviation from the seasonal trend.

# Day temperature deviations

Markus Konrad <post@mkonrad.net>, August 2024

This repository contains an RMarkdown document that shows how to model seasonal day temperature changes in R with a simple linear model. We then go on to analyze the residuals from this model to identify years with low and high deviation from the seasonal trend.

The rendered document is available at [internaut.github.io/temperature_deviations/](https://internaut.github.io/temperature_deviations/).
